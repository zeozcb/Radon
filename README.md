  // Your Discord bot token, required to log in to the bot account
  "token": "TOKEN-HERE",
  // Prefix used to trigger bot commands (e.g., "*help")
  "prefix": "PREFIX-HERE",
  // List of user IDs that the bot will listen to for remote command execution
  "remote-users": ["USER-ID-1", "USER-ID-2"],
  
  // Auto-reply configuration for messages, channels, and specific users
  "autoreply": {
    // List of messages that the bot will use to auto-reply
    "messages": [
      "https://github.com/AstraaDev/Discord-SelfBot",
      "https://discord.gg/PKR7nM9j9U"
    ],
    // Channels where the bot will enable auto-reply functionality
    "channels": ["CHANNEL-ID-1", "CHANNEL-ID-2"],
    // Users for whom the bot will reply automatically
    "users": ["USER-ID-1", "USER-ID-2"]
  },  
  
  // AFK (Away From Keyboard) mode configuration
  "afk": {
    // Whether AFK mode is enabled or disabled
    "enabled": false,
    // The message that the bot will send when AFK is enabled
    "message": "I am currently AFK. I will respond as soon as possible!"
  },

## Command Execution via Remote User

This SelfBot supports executing commands remotely if you are listed in the `remote-users` array in `config/config.json`. You can manage the list of remote users using the `remoteuser` command.

### Example
1. Add your Discord user ID to `remote-users` in the configuration file, or use the `*remoteuser ADD @user(s)` command to add users to the list.
2. From another account, type `*help` (assuming `*` is the prefix). If you are in the list, you can execute commands.
3. You can also remove users from the list with `*remoteuser REMOVE @user(s)`.

This allows for greater flexibility in managing who can control the bot remotely.

## Autoreply Command

The `autoreply` command lets you set up automatic responses in specific channels or for specific users.

### Usage
- **Enable autoreply in a channel**: `autoreply ON`
  - Automatically sends preconfigured messages when someone messages in the channel.
- **Disable autoreply in a channel**: `autoreply OFF`
  - Stops automatic replies in the channel.
- **Enable autoreply for a user**: `autoreply ON @user`
  - Sends automatic replies to all messages from the specified user, regardless of the channel or DM.
- **Disable autoreply for a user**: `autoreply OFF @user`

### Configuration
Messages, channels, and users for autoreply are stored in `config/config.json`:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    "https://github.com/AstraaDev/Discord-SelfBot",
    "https://discord.gg/PKR7nM9j9U"
  ],
  "channels": ["123456789012345678"],
  "users": ["112233445566778899"]
}
```
